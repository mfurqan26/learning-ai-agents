    "summary": "In this paper, we situate the educational movement of \"Ethics in\nMathematics,\" as outlined by the Cambridge University Ethics in Mathematics\nProject, in the wider area of mathematics ethics education. By focusing on the\ncore message coming out of Ethics in Mathematics, its target group, and\neducational philosophy, we set it into relation with \"Mathematics for Social\nJustice\" and Paul Ernest's recent work on ethics of mathematics. We conclude\nthat, although both Ethics in Mathematics and Mathematics for Social Justice\nappear antagonistic at first glance, they can be understood as complementary\nrather than competing educational strategies.",

Category-theoretic foundations of\nmathematics require a different philosophy of mathematics. While structural\nmathematics studies invariant forms (Awodey) categorical mathematics studies\ncovariant transformations which, generally, don t have any invariants. In this\npaper I develop a non-structuralist interpretation of categorical mathematics\nand show its consequences for history of mathematics and mathematics education.",
